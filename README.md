# WhisperWorkshop
## Introduction
This repository contains the material for the Whisper (transcription) workshop from AU Library at the Royal Danish Library. The purpose of the workshop is to use a digital tool to transform sound into text. The workshop focuses on OpenAI's Whisper model hosted in UCloud by SDU (Syddansk Universitet). In addition, the workshop will focus on best practices in relation to both transcription and the use of digital tools for data processing.
There are no expectations for previous experience with transcription, digital tools or ucloud.

## Workshop
There will be a hands-on exercise where participants can try Whisper. It will be possible to practice with a test sound clip that can be found in the Data folder.
